# MennaKhaled
ðŸ‘‹Hello, I'm Menna Khaled

Iâ€™m a Masterâ€™s candidate in Biotechnology at Cairo University, specializing in microbial genomics and bioinformatics.
As a biotechnologist, Iâ€™m passionate about linking wet-lab research with computational biology to uncover the molecular mechanisms that shape life at the multi-omics level.
My Research interests focus on integrating experimental biology with bioinformatics, developing analytical workflows to extract biological insights from high-throughput sequencing data.
Iâ€™m continuously learning across the omics disciplines; genomics, transcriptomics, and proteomics. With a growing focus on workflow design, data integration, and biological interpretation.
 I believe in the transformative power of computational biology to turn raw molecular data into discoveries that advance science and innovation.
